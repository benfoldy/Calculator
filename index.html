            <h1>Users, researchers question phone use as average user spends over 5 hours/day</h1>

            <p>After years sober from drugs and alcohol, Matthew found he had a new issue. It started with Facebook.</p>

            <p>"It caused a lot of anxiety in me because of the curation of people's lives," said Matthew, 41, who asked that his last name not be used. "You know it's false—or at least very curated—but still your mind is seeing people with endless amounts of vacation time and disposable income. It would leave me feeling angry and anxious so then I would kind of have to soothe that flood of emotion for me."</p>

            <p>For relief, he would turn to dating apps for validation.</p>

            <p>"I would remember just like waiting for the buzz in my pocket to happen, to get that rush and the chemicals in my heart that would rush to my brain," said Matthew. "That became a really big part of my life, something I was hungry for all the time."</p>

            <p>Matthew isn't alone. As smartphones have proliferated, so too has the space they take in our daily lives. The effects can be positive or negative, but their magnitude is indisputable: <a href = "http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/169545749110/state-of-mobile-2017-mobile-stagnates" target="_blank"> Flurry Analytics' "State of the Mobile 2017"<a> report found that users spend more than five hours a day on average on their smartphones. Whether spent shopping, sharing, streaming video or seeking something more, the result is market of attention in which time is at a premium.</p>
            
            <p>The smartphone spread so quickly that researchers are only beginning to catch up. Many, however, caution against simply fitting phone use into the framework of addiction.</p>

            <p>"We need to find a nuanced and fine-grained view of what people are doing with media," said Dave Markowitz, who will begin as an assistant professor of social media data analytics at the University of Oregon's School of Journalism and Communication this fall.</p>

            <p>While a PhD student at Stanford University, Markowitz conducted <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=229087098105066065000029125031110099098073020038068011091080029111003024074073071027060118002034019104038023069000064088074026020039005023014120115064005064071105119010065042003007091122005108095095117005112004108098098031092113076105099070088073111091&EXT=pdf" target="_blank"> an experiment with Jeff Hancock, Jeremy N. Bailenson and Byron Reeves<a> to see how students reacted to being denied access to their phones. 125 students were randomly assigned into three groups before sitting alone in a room. One group could use their phones, one group could sit with their phones but were told to resist using it and one group had to sit alone with no phone. Students without their phone had the most trouble concentrating and discomfort.</p>

            <p>For Markowitz, this is not a statement on the phone's addictive qualities but rather an indication that the phone offers something we should strive to understand.</p>

            <p>"The mobile phone is an important device," he said. "People feel different, psychologically and physically different when they don't have access to it. We need to delve into what about the mobile phone makes people feel when they don't have it that makes them feel that they want it."</p>

            <p>Matthew agrees that the desire to us the phone comes from a desire for connection.</p> 

            <p>"I think at its root, we're so uncomfortable being in the present moment," said Matthew. "We're uncomfortable with silence, we're uncomfortable with being alone and a phone provides that instant, immediate relief of having to be somewhere without anything to hold on to."</p>

            <p>But five years removed from Facebook and three years removed from dating apps, he feels more present and connected than before.</p>

            <p>"Getting rid of the apps was bittersweet but when I put them down, a world opened up of awareness in the real world," he said. "Really simple things. Like it sounds so cinematic, but the sky—I was looking up rather than looking down and I was noticing the world, like trees and architecture and sky and the world at large."</p>
